Real-Time Memory Allocation Tracker is a simulation project that demonstrates how memory is managed in an operating system using Segmentation and Paging techniques. The primary goal of this project is to provide a clear understanding of how processes are allocated memory in real time and how logical addresses are translated into physical addresses. This tool is especially useful for students and learners who want to visualize and explore the inner workings of memory management strategies.

The project allows users to create and remove processes dynamically, showing how memory is divided and allocated using both segmentation and paging methods. In segmentation, the memory is split into variable-sized segments based on the logical divisions such as code, data, and stack. On the other hand, paging breaks memory into fixed-size pages and frames, which helps in minimizing external fragmentation. The tracker updates the memory layout in real time, making it easy to observe how memory blocks are utilized or freed as processes come and go.

In addition to showing memory layouts, the tracker also provides insights into address translation, fragmentation (both internal and external), and the efficiency of each memory management technique. Users can compare the performance of segmentation and paging side by side, understanding where each technique is more suitable. Whether you are using a command-line interface or a graphical user interface (depending on your implementation), this tool ensures an interactive and educational experience for better conceptual clarity.

This project is built using simple and efficient data structures like arrays and linked lists, and can be implemented in languages such as C++, Python, or JavaScript depending on preference. It serves as an ideal learning aid for operating systems coursework, lab demos, and practical examinations.
