Real-Time Allocation Tracker and Paging/Segmentation Techniques
Overview
This project is a comprehensive tool for visualizing and understanding memory management techniques in operating systems. It includes:

Real-Time Allocation Tracker: Monitors and visualizes memory allocation and deallocation in real-time, providing insights into memory usage patterns.
Paging System: An interactive visualization of memory address translation and page replacement algorithms (FIFO, LRU, Clock), demonstrating how virtual addresses are mapped to physical addresses.
Segmentation Techniques: (Placeholder - to be detailed based on your implementation) Visualizes memory segmentation, showing how logical address spaces are divided into segments.

The project is built using Python and PyQt5, offering a user-friendly GUI for exploring these memory management concepts. It is designed for educational purposes, helping students and developers understand memory allocation, paging, and segmentation.
Features

Real-Time Allocation Tracker:

Displays live memory allocation and deallocation events.
Visualizes memory blocks, free/used memory, and allocation strategies (e.g., first-fit, best-fit, worst-fit).
(Add specific features of your tracker, e.g., metrics, graphs, or supported allocation algorithms).


Paging System:

Address Translation Tab:
Visualize virtual-to-physical address translation with animations.
Select processes (A, B, C) with unique page tables.
Choose page sizes (4KB, 8KB, 16KB, 64KB).
Input virtual addresses manually or generate random addresses.
Display page table entries (virtual page, physical frame, valid bit, referenced, modified).
Handle page faults with clear visual feedback.


Page Replacement Tab:
Simulate page replacement algorithms: FIFO, LRU, and Clock.
Generate random page reference strings.
Animate page replacement steps with real-time updates to physical frames and page fault counts.
Provide explanations of each algorithm.




Segmentation Techniques:

(Placeholder) Visualize segment tables and address translation.
Demonstrate segment-based memory management.
(Add specific features, e.g., segment size visualization, protection mechanisms, or segment fault handling).



Prerequisites

Python: Version 3.8 or higher.
PyQt5: For the graphical user interface.
Optional Dependencies: (Add any dependencies specific to your allocation tracker or segmentation components, e.g., psutil for system monitoring, numpy for calculations).

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-allocation-tracker.git
cd real-time-allocation-tracker


Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install PyQt5

Install additional dependencies if required:
pip install <additional-package>


Verify Installation:Ensure all dependencies are installed:
pip list



Usage

Run the Application:
python enhanced_paging_system.py

Alternatively, if you have a main entry point (e.g., main.py):
python main.py


Explore the Interface:

Address Translation Tab:
Select a process (A, B, or C) from the dropdown.
Choose a page size (4KB, 8KB, 16KB, 64KB).
Enter a virtual address or click "Random" to generate one.
Click "Translate Address" to see the translation process animated, with page table updates and fault handling.


Page Replacement Tab:
Select an algorithm (FIFO, LRU, Clock).
Click "Generate New Reference String" for a new sequence.
Use "Start Animation" to run the simulation, "Stop Animation" to pause, or "Step" to advance manually.
Observe page faults and frame updates in real-time.


Real-Time Allocation Tracker:
(Add instructions, e.g., "View live memory usage in the Allocation tab", "Select allocation strategy").


Segmentation Techniques:
(Add instructions, e.g., "Navigate to the Segmentation tab to view segment tables", "Enter segment offsets").




Interact with Visualizations:

The status bar displays animated messages for actions (e.g., address translation results, algorithm changes).
Page tables highlight invalid pages in red.
Animations in the Address Translation tab show the journey from virtual address to physical address.

Example
To visualize address translation:

Run python enhanced_paging_system.py.
Go to the Address Translation tab.
Select "Process A" and "4 KB" page size.
Enter 4096 as the virtual address and click "Translate Address".
Observe the animation showing the virtual address mapping to a physical address, with the page table updated.

To simulate page replacement:

Switch to the Page Replacement tab.
Select "LRU" algorithm.
Click "Generate New Reference String".
Click "Start Animation" to watch the algorithm process the reference string, updating frames and counting page faults.
